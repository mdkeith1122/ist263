        <p>Set in the busy city of Manhattan, this movie follows the crazy scheme of two  overworked assistants attempting to matchmake their bosses in order for some more downtime. It follows Harper, the assistant to a major sports journalist, and Charlie, who works for a huge venture capitalist. Overall, this movie has many good things going for it—leads who share a sense of dry and teasing humor, sharp dialogue, and characters that we as the audience actually care about. I enjoy how is combines different aspects of a romantic, workplace, and generic city living comedy into one film. It feels youthful and relatable at the same time. One critique I have comes with the portrayal of the bosses. They, as characters, are written as very Type A, uptight, controlling, and sometimes just downright mean. My issue with this is that they are portrayed by two people of color, who, in reality, would have had to work incredibly hard for their positions and that aspect is never touched on at all. Overall, this doesn’t take away from the ability to enjoy the film, and I genuinely have not laughed this much at a Netflix original in a long time.</p>
