        <p>“Coco” is the story of an energetic and lively young boy named Miguel, and all he wants to do is play music. The issue with this is that his family has banned music because his grandfather, who became a huge musician, left his grandmother to go on tour, and she never wanted to hear music again. This film is one of the most accurate portrayals of Mexican culture, as it takes place on La Día de los Muertos, or the Day of the Dead. It uses a fresh tone and beautifully detailed animation in order to make the audience feel as if they are a part of the culture and not some tourist looking in. The themes of family and love are heavily emphasized through original songs such as “Remember Me” which bring me to tears every time. Any small qualms I have about this film disappear as soon as it’s over. </p>
