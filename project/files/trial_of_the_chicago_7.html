        <p>One of the newer films on this list, I had to include it for the ways that is it gave me goosebumps in almost every scene for almost always different reasons. Immediately, director Aaron Sorkin throws the audience into the chaos that is the riots in Chicago 1968, and we are introduced to the star-studded cast including Eddie Redmayne and Sacha Baron Cohen. These big-time actors are able to keep up with the quick paced dialogue which keeps the movie moving and the audience engaged at all times. They are able to push through the dense subject matter and tell the story of what happened to these men while facing trial. One of the most memorable things this movie does is incorporate real footage of the riots in the park. These clips are seamlessly weaved into the story; they are in black and white which helps to differentiate them from the film of the movie but does not jar the audience and take them out of the reality of the story. One critique of this film I have is that the overall story gets a bit hazy from the point of directing, as there is so much content to jam into a two-hour film. Other than that, the music used throughout the film as a whole contributes to the feelings of the characters and allows for us to feel their frustrations, heartbreaks, and passions as the story moves along.</p>
