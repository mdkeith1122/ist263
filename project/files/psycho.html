        <p>This is the one Alfred Hitchcock film to have the greatest impact. Filmed in black and white and with a low budget, he wanted it to feel like a cheap film noir piece. He focuses heavily on the development of the daunting house that Norman and his mother live in, and the relationship between Norman himself and his mother. The most revolutionary thing about this film is the viewing experience that Hitchcock created for the audience not only when making the film but in theaters as well. Similar to a theme park experience, movie goers would listen to a recording of Hitchcock’s voice while standing in line urging viewers to not give out spoilers after they have seen the film. Also, people who showed up late were not allowed in, as it would take those who were already there out of the experience. This movie paved the way for thrillers by showing how the focus on small elements of the plot and how to portray them in things such as set dressing and dialogue, or lack thereof. The most iconic scene that is still a frequent reference in pop culture today is the shower scene. The interesting thing about it is that it never actually shows the knife creating wounds, it uses a quick montage technique to allow the audience to put together what is happening on their own. It showed how there was more to creating a horror scene than simply showing blood and gore; it highlighted the appreciation to small details, and that makes this one of the greatest films of all time. </p>
