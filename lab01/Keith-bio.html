        My name is Maddie Keith and I'm from Bucks County, PA. I am a TRF major with hopes of one day producing film and television. In my free time I like to hang out with my dogs and my twin sister.I also enjoy listening to podcasts and watching Netflix. My favorite show is Arrested Development because Jason Bateman is one of my favorite actors. My favorite place to be is the beach, and I am currently learning to surf.
